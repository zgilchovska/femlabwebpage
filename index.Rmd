# **Who we are**
</div>
&nbsp;

<div align="justify">
We are an international group of early career researchers (ECRs), working in the social and life sciences, who passionately believe in making academia a better place for underrepresented people. We ourselves are of diverse cultural, national, linguistic, gender, and neural ability as well as social backgrounds. 

The Feminist WonderLab Collective was founded after a hackathon at a meeting of the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS) 2022 on “Feminist ways of doing science”, co-organized by Kohinoor Darda, Helena Hartmann and Sarah Sauvé. The Collective meets online at least once a month to work on projects related to feminist perspectives on science, teaching, and academia. To check out our past and current projects, please visit [Projects and resources](projects.html) page.

We currently have eight members and always welcome more like-minded scholars (in or outside of academia), from any fields and backgrounds. If you'd like to join, please get in touch with any of our current members. Our current members are:

I call myself a feminist music scientist because I’m interested in how the brain processes music and how we go about doing science, with goals of equity and justice. Outside of the academy, I sing in the Lincoln Choral Society, am involved in activist organizations (Extinction Rebellion, Stand up to racism), am learning to sew clothes and run to dissolve the stresses of life.

<div align="justify">
I am interested in factors that influence how we perceive pain in ourselves and in other people. I also conduct research on how our positive and negative expectations affect the success of medical treatments and what happens in the brain during these processes. My approach to science strongly aligns with open scholarship principles. Next to my work as a researcher, I enthusiastically engage in and teach science communication. My non-academic passions are writing short stories for my project <a href="https://scienceandfiction.net/" target="_blank">Science & Fiction</a>, yoga, sorting books by color, and bread baking.
I'm also Feminist Wonder Lab's Code of conduct community leader.

I am interested in how art and design can be used to promote wellness and facilitate emotion regulation in the general and clinical population. My research interests include among others the influence of expertise and psychophysiological characteristics in aesthetic and emotional experiences. Outside of the lab, I love contemporary dance, traveling, baking, gardening, playing with my dog, or buying more books and plants.
I'm also Feminist Wonder Lab's mailing list contact person.

I am interested in the biopsychosocial risk and protective factors of stress-related psychopathology. I am a proponent of increasing diversity in psychological and brain sciences and pride myself in my outreach activities. Outside the lab I love anything food related (from cooking to eating), watching and playing sports (especially football) and music (concerts and dancing).

I am interested in the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie our interactions in the social world and our engagement with art. As an Indian classical dancer, I like to integrate my background in the performing arts and my interest in neuroscience in both my research and choreographic endeavours. Outside of the lab, I enjoy social interactions with fictional characters in novels, underwater aesthetic experiences when scuba diving, and finding the next triathlon I can sign up to!

I investigate bilingual language control in healthy aging and aging with cognitive impairment. I’m a psychologist and neuroscientist, and my research interests are bi- and multilingualism, cognition and aging, and brain functioning, structure and neurochemistry of healthy aging and dementia. My passion for Open Scholarship stems from my own educational struggles to access knowledge and I’d like to provide a better start for my students. In my free time I like learning languages, doing aerial arts and singing flamenco (or anything else) to my many plants.

<div align="justify">
I'm a personality psychologist and postdoctoral researcher at University of Graz, Austria. I am interested in what people think about their own abilities and the abilities of others. Recently, I have been asking myself whether these beliefs about abilities are related to gender (e.g., Do women underestimate themselves? And are they underestimated by other people as well?). My other research interests include romantic relationships and sexuality. I am passionate about open research practices and initiatives that try to improve the working conditions of early-career researchers. When I am not in the office, I love being in nature, traveling, and going to concerts.
